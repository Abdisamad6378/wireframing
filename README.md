What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a low-fidelity, simplified outline of a webpage or application's layout. It is a skeletal framework that represents the basic structure, key components, and information hierarchy of a user interface. Think of it as the architectural blueprint for a digital product; it defines the placement of elements like headers, navigation, content areas, buttons, and forms without any stylistic design (like colors, fonts, or images).

Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing is a critical early step in the design and development process for several key reasons:

Establishes Structure and Hierarchy: It forces a focus on the placement and priority of content and functionality, ensuring the user's attention is guided to the most important elements first.

Facilitates Early Feedback: Because they are quick and cheap to create, wireframes allow stakeholders and users to provide feedback on the core layout and flow before any visual design or code is written. This prevents costly changes later in the process.

Clarifies Functionality: They help developers and designers align on how the interface will work, clarifying features and user interactions in a visual way that requirements documents alone cannot.

Saves Time and Resources: Identifying and resolving layout and usability issues at the wireframe stage is significantly more efficient than doing so after high-fidelity designs have been completed or code has been written.
